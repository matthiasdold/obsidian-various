### Config
I do have my config on the macos under `./config/tmux/tmux.conf`


### Cheat sheets
Not mine and does not map 1 to 1 to my config yet, but a good starting point [here](https://gist.github.com/henrik/1967800)

###### Window management
Windows are like tabs:
- Spawn a new window `prefix + c`
- Get a tree view of windows `prefix + w`
- Delete spawn a tree (`prefix + w`) the select and press `x` the confirm with `y`
- Switch by `prefix + <number of window>`

##### Basic elements
Moving between splits is done via `<C-h>, <C-j>, <C-k>,€‹¡¡™ <C-h>`


### Having the terminal startup tmux always
Tmux is started by my fish shell -> I used [this](https://medium.com/@HazuliFidastian/run-tmux-automatically-on-fish-shell-2b62622661c7)
