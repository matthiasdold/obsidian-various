## My understanding of the topic
* Actions to improve mood (AIM), AIM-R and AIM-C are two psychometric test. Psychometric properties (content validity, reliability)
	* it is to be analysed how test/re-test reliability is,
	* AIM-R (resident) vs AIM-C (caretaker)
	* Analysis of inter-rater-reliability for AIM-C
- The test try to capture what everyday practises actually contribute to treatment, although they would not be officially considered so
## General remarks:

- I like how you introduce the research gap as psychometric properties for for AIM-R/C

## Open questions:
- Participants
	- How many are you planning for?
	- Any exclusion criteria?
	- Why did you include patients with dementia -> potential hidden confounder?
- What steps are required for study 1? -> "just" asking how relevant R and C deem the questions?
- How will the evaluation for study 3 be conducted: What are the metrics if there can be any?
- You mention as aim: to what extend fully represent -> is there any way of knowing how much is "not covered"?
- How would you use the AIM in business as usual setups?
