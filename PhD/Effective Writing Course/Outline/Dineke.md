## My understanding of the topic
* SAQ
	* There is a spinal appearance questionnaire 
	* Will be filled by patients (young adolescence) and parents
		* Scores will be compared
* The conclusion would be along the lines of "combining both scores is better"

## General remarks:
- I really like the structure, it makes a good narrative and lead introduces also a read who is new to the SAQ.
- It it clear that you will have three dimensions of metrics which will be analysed: Pict. item level, Statements and total scores.

## Open questions:
* Patient exclusion criteria?
* How many patients would be the target (statistical significance?)
* How is level of agreement determined?
* What would be the impact of treatment if the score would differ / consequences?
* Is the idea to have parents rate new?
