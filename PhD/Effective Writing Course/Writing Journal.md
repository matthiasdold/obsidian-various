- [ ] Finalise the outline after pivoting to writing a paper. Assume the insights from FaceStim could be published
- Although writing is still a Frog to eat, writting a very detailed outline is much easier than writing the full test
- I really like to work through the outline with questions in mind instead of topics... It seems like I am writing a more comprehensive outline this way.
- actually writing down what we investigated with regards to the INFER experiment was also somewhat rewarding, as I somehow saw how much content actually was covered, although not successful in the end, it feels worth to share what we did, so none else will have to test it.
