#DBS #Stroop #PD
- [ ] Read up 16 - for contingent negative variation (CNV)

### Setup
- Time locked stimulation pulses
	- 11 pulses @ 103Hz monophasic
	- 1.92+-0.76 mA
- 13 patients (some exclusions; effectively 10 left)
- Only stim off contralateral data was analysed
- right hemisphere is more involved in response inhibition, see 18,19 

### Analysis
- LFP only channel with highest beta chosen
- Baseline -3 to -1s
- Excluding trials with RT <0.3s and >1.8s
- Also use a cluster permutation testing approach with a t-test basis

## Main results
- event-related stimulation reduces Stroop effect by speeding up RT on conflicting trials.
- stimulation also increases errors especially in the early period after word cue
- 
### Side notes
- Potentially interesting: Analysis of error -> also potentially few errors per class (10-20% error range usually). Could be used comparably for INFER.
