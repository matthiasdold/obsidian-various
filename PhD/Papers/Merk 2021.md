title: Electrocorticography is superior to subthalamic local field potentials for movement decoding in Parkinsonâ€™s disease

tags: #DBS #ECoG #LFP #XGBOOST #PD

- 11 PD patients interoperatively
- decoding grip force from ECoG and LFP

## Results
- Best R^2 (trained Wiener Filter) achieved with 40 features = 8 freq bands * 5 time points in `[-500, 0]` per channel
- SPoC + XGB resulted in best decoding R^2 (for contralateral side)
- Taking more than the best channel did not help to improve
- ECoG more important than LFP
- Low beta bursts seems important for motor encoding
- Prediction of how well a recording site would be capable of decoding grip-power, based of connectome is possible
