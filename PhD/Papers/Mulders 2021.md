#PD #Stroop #DBS #cognitive
- 49 PD patients
- Measuring cognitive decline 1y after. Patients where observed and then categorised in decline or non-decline group.
> Only a few patients showed clinically relevant cognitive decline

- Tasks:
	- Stroop
	- [[Trail Maker Test#Type B]]
	- category fluency performance 
	- letter fluency performance
- [[Multiple Regression Analysis]] vs UPDRS III improvement and performance scores predicted from surgical characteristics left and right

## Main results
- Significant Stroop (medium), TMT-B (small) and in both category and letter fluency performance (large effect size)
- Changes in TMT-B were significantly associated with right coronal angle. But nothing else.
- Cognitive decline was much higher in older participants for Stroop.
